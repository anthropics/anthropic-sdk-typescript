## Setting up the environment

This repository uses [`yarn@v1`](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install).
Other package managers may work but are not officially supported for development.

To set up the repository, run:

```sh
$ yarn
$ yarn build
```

This will install all the required dependencies and build output files to `dist/`.

## Modifying/Adding code

Most of the SDK is generated code. Modifications to code will be persisted between generations, but may
result in merge conflicts between manual patches and changes from the generator. The generator will never
modify the contents of the `src/lib/` and `examples/` directories.

## Adding and running examples

All files in the `examples/` directory are not modified by the generator and can be freely edited or added to.

```ts
// add an example to examples/<your-example>.ts

#!/usr/bin/env -S npm run tsn -T
…
```

```sh
$ chmod +x examples/<your-example>.ts
# run the example against your api
$ yarn tsn -T examples/<your-example>.ts
```

## Using the repository from source

If you’d like to use the repository from source, you can either install from git or link to a cloned repository:

To install via git:

```sh
$ npm install git+ssh://git@github.com:stainless-sdks/anthropic-typescript.git
```

Alternatively, to link a local copy of the repo:

```sh
# Clone
$ git clone https://www.github.com/stainless-sdks/anthropic-typescript
$ cd anthropic-typescript

# With yarn
$ yarn link
$ cd ../my-package
$ yarn link @anthropic-ai/sdk

# With pnpm
$ pnpm link --global
$ cd ../my-package
$ pnpm link -—global @anthropic-ai/sdk
```

## Running tests

Most tests require you to [set up a mock server](https://github.com/stoplightio/prism) against the OpenAPI spec to run the tests.

```sh
$ npx prism mock path/to/your/openapi.yml
```

```sh
$ yarn run test
```

## Linting and formatting

[eslint](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint) to format the code in the repository.

To lint:

```sh
$ yarn lint
```

To format and fix all lint issues automatically:
