# Anthropic Vertex TypeScript API Library

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This API is in private preview.

[![NPM version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@anthropic-ai/vertex-sdk.svg)](https://npmjs.org/package/@anthropic-ai/vertex-sdk)

This library provides convenient access to the private preview of the Anthropic Vertex API.

For the non-Vertex Anthropic API at api.anthropic.com, see [`@anthropic-ai/sdk`](https://github.com/anthropics/anthropic-sdk-typescript).

## Installation

```sh
npm install @anthropic-ai/vertex-sdk
```

## Usage

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```js
import { AnthropicVertex } from '@anthropic-ai/vertex-sdk';

// Reads from the `CLOUD_ML_REGION` & `ANTHROPIC_VERTEX_PROJECT_ID` environment variables.
// Additionally goes through the standard `google-auth-library` flow.
const client = new AnthropicVertex();

async function main() {
  const result = await client.messages.create({
    messages: [
      {
        role: 'user',
        content: 'Hey Claude! How can I recursively list all files in a directory in Rust?',
      },
    ],
    model: 'claude-instant-1p2',
    max_tokens: 300,
  });
  console.log(JSON.stringify(result, null, 2));
}

main();
```

For more details on how to use the SDK, see the [README.md for the main Anthropic SDK](https://github.com/anthropics/anthropic-sdk-typescript/tree/main#anthropic-typescript-api-library) which this library extends.
