   * Returns plugin usage metrics for the organization across Cowork and Claude Code,
   * sorted by plugin name. The `plugin_name` value `third-party` is an aggregate
   * bucket, not a plugin: it collects plugin activity, from either surface, for
   * which the reporting client did not provide a plugin name — so an organization's
   * own plugins can contribute both to their own named rows and to this bucket. Use
   * `group_by[]` to break usage out per member, per RBAC group, or per product
   * surface (Cowork / Claude Code), and `filter[]` to scope results; the parameter
   * descriptions list the supported dimensions. Requires an API key with the
   * `read:analytics` scope. `starting_date` / `ending_date` select range-rollup mode
   * like `/skills`.
   *
   * @example
   * ```ts
   * // Automatically fetches more pages as needed.
   * for await (const betaAnalyticsPluginActivity of client.beta.organization.analytics.plugins.list()) {
